# Introduction

In this project, I will be diving into the financial and operational data of Global Superstore for the year 2014. Using a combination of data exploration and analytical methods, the goal is to reveal valuable insights and patterns within the dataset. The inquiries cover diverse areas such as country-specific profitability, shipping expenses, subcategories of products, customer tendencies, and geographical trends. The findings from this analysis will provide a comprehensive view of the company's performance, offering insights that can guide informed decisions for improving operations and boosting profitability.
